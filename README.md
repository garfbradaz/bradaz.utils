# bradaz.utils
Utlility Libraries I have created.

This now includes

1. CSV Reader for C#:
  * Implementation of a CSV File (CSVRows and CSVColumns)
  * Simple example applications to show how to use (Winform with a DataGridView and a Console App).
  * Ability to provide a settings file which describes the column type so that a dynamic can be created and referenced at runtime
  * [RFC4180 implementation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180)


##Trello Board for ideas:

You can track what I'm doing or planning on doing [here](https://trello.com/b/JTvVlc84/csvreader).
